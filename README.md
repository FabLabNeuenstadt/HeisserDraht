We use a Arduino Mega, a seven segment display and a LCD

Wire-wiring: 
- 22: start
- 24: stop
- 26: mistake
- 28: buzzer
- A0: penalty time

In this implementation start and stop are interchangeable, we can
begin from either side. We trigger the start/stop with our game loop

Connections for seven segment display:
45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52

Connections LCD:
- rs (LCD pin 4) to Arduino pin 12
- rw (LCD pin 5) to Arduino pin 11
- enable (LCD pin 6) to Arduino pin 10
- LCD pin 15 to Arduino pin 13
- LCD pins d4, d5, d6, d7 to Arduino pins 5, 4, 3, 2

## Serial communication of game state

When the game runs, we send the current state of the game via serial
connection to use a bigger display powered by a Raspberry Pi.

All messages have the format

> mm:ss:xxx;mmm;status

- __mm__: Minutes
- __ss__: Seconds
- __xxx__: Milliseconds
- __mmm__: Current count of mistakes
- __status__ can be:
	- __Start__: The start of a game
	- __Reset__: The player has gone back to the start
	- __Mistake__: A mistake was made
	- __Stop__: The player has completed a run

Special Case: When the status is "Start" then the time in front of it
is not the current time (which is 00:00.000) but rather the penalty time
of this run that is added for each mistake made.
